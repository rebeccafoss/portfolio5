# Building on the shoulders of giants: meta-analysis

## Questions to be answered

1. What is the current evidence for distinctive vocal patterns in schizophrenia? Report how many papers report quantitative estimates, comment on what percentage of the overall studies reviewed they represent (see PRISMA chart) your method to analyze them, the estimated effect size of the difference (mean effect size and standard error) and forest plots representing it. N.B. Only measures of pitch mean and pitch sd are required for the assignment. Feel free to ignore the rest (although pause behavior looks interesting, if you check my article).

2. Do the results match your own analysis from Assignment 3? If you add your results to the meta-analysis, do the estimated effect sizes change? Report the new estimates and the new forest plots.

3. Assess the quality of the literature: report and comment on heterogeneity of the studies (tau, I2), on publication bias (funnel plot), and on influential studies.

## Tips on the process to follow:

- Download the data on all published articles analyzing voice in schizophrenia and the prisma chart as reference of all articles found and reviewed

```{r}
# load package 
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, readxl, lme4, metafor, dplyr, gridExtra)

# load data
xl <- readxl::read_excel("Matrix_MetaAnalysis_Diagnosis_updated290719.xlsx")


```


- Look through the dataset to find out which columns to use, and if there is any additional information written as comments (real world data is always messy!).
    * Hint: PITCH_F0M and PITCH_F0SD group of variables are what you need
    * Hint: Make sure you read the comments in the columns: `pitch_f0_variability`, `frequency`, `Title`,  `ACOUST_ANA_DESCR`, `DESCRIPTION`, and `COMMENTS`


```{r}

xl_subset <- xl %>% select(
  StudyID, #studyID
  Article, #article

  TYPE_OF_TASK, # task

  #feature 1 -mean of pitch in the groups

# overview of all colnames

    StudyID, pitch_f0_variability, 
    frequency...68, frequency...73, frequency...78, frequency...83, frequency...88,
    Title)

# only thing we do is make mean values in study 18 to NA's.
xl_subset$m_m_hc <- ifelse(xl_subset$studyID == 18, NA, xl_subset$m_m_hc)
xl_subset$m_m_sz <- ifelse(xl_subset$studyID == 18, NA, xl_subset$m_m_sz)

# study 15 will be overwrited with NA
xl_subset$m_sd_hc <- ifelse(xl_subset$studyID == 15, NA, xl_subset$m_sd_hc)
xl_subset$m_sd_sz <- ifelse(xl_subset$studyID == 15, NA, xl_subset$m_sd_sz)
xl_subset$sd_sd_hc <- ifelse(xl_subset$studyID == 15, NA, xl_subset$sd_sd_hc)
xl_subset$sd_sd_sz <- ifelse(xl_subset$studyID == 15, NA, xl_subset$sd_sd_sz)

```

- Following the procedure in the slides calculate effect size and standard error of the effect size per each study. N.B. we focus on pitch mean and pitch standard deviation.
 . first try using lmer (to connect to what you know of mixed effects models)
 . then use rma() (to get some juicy additional statistics)

```{r}

# feature 1
xl_subset <- escalc("SMD", #"SMD" for the standardized mean difference.
                      n1i = n_sz, n2i = n_hc,
                      m1i = m_m_sz, m2i = m_m_hc,
                      sd1i = sd_m_sz, sd2i = sd_m_hc,
                      data = xl_subset)
colnames(xl_subset)[15] <- "ES_mean"
colnames(xl_subset)[16] <- "var_ES_mean"

# feature 2
xl_subset <- escalc("SMD", #"SMD" for the standardized mean difference.
                      n1i = n_sz, n2i = n_hc,
                      m1i = m_sd_sz, m2i = m_sd_hc,
                      sd1i = sd_sd_sz, sd2i = sd_sd_hc,
                      data = xl_subset)
colnames(xl_subset)[17] <- "ES_variability"
colnames(xl_subset)[18] <- "var_ES_variability"



# Mixed effects regression to assess the meta-analytic effect size
# lmer
f1model <- lmer(ES_mean ~ 1 + task + (1|studyID), data = xl_subset, weights = 1/var_ES_mean, REML=F,
     control = lmerControl(
       check.nobs.vs.nlev="ignore", 
       check.nobs.vs.nRE="ignore"))

f2model <- lmer(ES_variability ~ 1 + task + (1|studyID), data = xl_subset, weights = 1/var_ES_variability, REML=F,
     control = lmerControl(
       check.nobs.vs.nlev="ignore", 
       check.nobs.vs.nRE="ignore"))

#rma
# Feature 1
f1_rma <- rma(ES_mean, var_ES_mean, data = xl_subset, slab=article)

# Feature 2
f2_rma <- rma(ES_variability, var_ES_variability, data = xl_subset, slab=article)
f2_rma

# What if we have a fixed effect?
f1_rmafix <- rma(ES_mean, var_ES_mean, mods = cbind(task), data = xl_subset, slab=article)
f1_rmafix
f2_rmafix <- rma(ES_variability, var_ES_variability, mods = cbind(task), data = xl_subset, slab=article)
f2_rmafix

# Build a forest plot of the results
forest(f1_rma)
forest(f2_rma)
forest(f1_rmafix)
forest(f2_rmafix)

```

- Go back to Assignment 3, add your own study to the data table, and re-run meta-analysis. Do the results change?

```{r}
# read data
voice <- read_csv("/Users/rebeccakjeldsen/Dropbox/CogSci3/ExMet3/Portfolios/portfolio5/features_unscaled.csv")

# devide in subsets for hc and sz
voice_sz <- subset(voice, Diagnosis == "1") 
voice_hc <- subset(voice, Diagnosis == "0")

# Make a new row where the right values are extracted
new.row <- data.frame(
  studyID=51,
  article="Fusaroli et al.(2019)",
  diagnosis="SZ", 
  task = "CONSTR", 
  n_sz = sum(n_distinct(voice_sz$Participant)),
  n_hc = sum(n_distinct(voice_hc$Participant)),
  m_m_hc = mean(voice_hc$mean_pitch),
  sd_m_hc = sd(voice_hc$mean_pitch),
  m_m_sz = mean(voice_sz$mean_pitch),
  sd_m_sz = sd(voice_sz$mean_pitch),
  m_sd_hc = mean(voice_hc$sd_pitch),
  sd_sd_hc = sd(voice_hc$sd_pitch),
  m_sd_sz = mean(voice_sz$sd_pitch),
  sd_sd_sz = sd(voice_sz$sd_pitch))

# add escalc values for both features
new.row <- escalc("SMD", #"SMD" for the standardized mean difference.
                      n1i = n_sz,
                      n2i = n_hc,
                      m1i = m_m_sz,
                      m2i = m_m_hc,
                      sd1i = sd_m_sz,
                      sd2i = sd_m_hc,
                      data = new.row)
colnames(new.row)[15] <- "ES_mean"
colnames(new.row)[16] <- "var_ES_mean"

new.row <- escalc("SMD", #"SMD" for the standardized mean difference.
                      n1i = n_sz,
                      n2i = n_hc,
                      m1i = m_sd_sz,
                      m2i = m_sd_hc,
                      sd1i = sd_sd_sz,
                      sd2i = sd_sd_hc,
                      data = new.row)
colnames(new.row)[17] <- "ES_variability"
colnames(new.row)[18] <- "var_ES_variability"

# Merge new row with the dataframe xl_subset
xl_subset <- rbind(xl_subset, new.row)
```

Run all data

```{r}
# Mixed effects regression to assess the meta-analytic effect size
# lmer
f1model_new <- lmer(ES_mean ~ 1 + task + (1|studyID), data = xl_subset, weights = 1/var_ES_mean, REML=F,
     control = lmerControl(
       check.nobs.vs.nlev="ignore", 
       check.nobs.vs.nRE="ignore"))

f2model_new <- lmer(ES_variability ~ 1 + task + (1|studyID), data = xl_subset, weights = 1/var_ES_variability, REML=F,
     control = lmerControl(
       check.nobs.vs.nlev="ignore", 
       check.nobs.vs.nRE="ignore"))

#rma
# Feature 1
f1_rma_new <- rma(ES_mean, var_ES_mean, data = xl_subset, slab=article)

# Feature 2
f2_rma_new <- rma(ES_variability, var_ES_variability, data = xl_subset, slab=article)

# What if we have a fixed effect?
f1_rmafix_new <- rma(ES_mean, var_ES_mean, mods = cbind(task), data = xl_subset, slab=studyID)
f2_rmafix_new <- rma(ES_variability, var_ES_variability, mods = cbind(task), data = xl_subset, slab=studyID)

# Build a forest plot of the results
forest(f1_rma_new)
forest(f2_rma_new)
forest(f1_rmafix_new)
forest(f2_rmafix_new)

```
Report and comment on heterogeneity of the studies (tau, I2), on publication bias (funnel plot), and on influential studies.
- Now look at the output of rma() 
      - and check tau (Tau square is a measure of overall variance) 
      - and I2 (I square is the proportion of variance due to heterogeneity, aka, that cannot be reduced to within-study        uncertainty)

```{r}
# to get Tau and I^2
summary(f1_rmafix_new)
summary(f2_rmafix_new)

# funnel plot
funnel(f1_rmafix_new, main = "feature 1 RMA", xlab = "Standardized Mean Difference")
funnel(f2_rmafix_new, main = "feature 2 RMA", xlab = "Standardized Mean Difference")

# influential studies
inf_f1 <- influence(f1_rma_new)
print(inf_f1)
plot(inf_f1)

inf_f2 <- influence(f2_rma_new)
print(inf_f2)
plot(inf_f2)

```
